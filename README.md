# ITEMMANAGER: A Simple React-Based Application

**ITEMMANAGER** is a straightforward React project that allows users to add, update, and delete products seamlessly. While it does not include advanced features like authentication (e.g., login, registration, or email verification), the primary focus of this project was to practice working with APIs and understanding their integration.

## About the Project

This project is a foundational MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application. The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with essential backend-to-frontend functionalities, including:

- Handling API responses effectively.
- Connecting the backend to a database.
- Implementing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Through **ITEMMANAGER**, the focus was on mastering the fundamentals of building and managing APIs, as well as integrating them into a user-friendly frontend.
